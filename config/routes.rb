  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html

  # When we receive a `GET` request with URL `/about`, then Rails will invoke
  # the `about_controller` with `index` action (action is just a method that is
  # defined within a controller)
  get('/about', { to: 'about#index' })
  # get '/about', to: 'about#index'

  # you can also write it as:
  # get('/about' => 'about#index')

  # if you don't pass an `as:` option then Rails will attempt to generate a URL
  # / PATH helper for you. If you pass the `as:` option then Rails will use
  # that as the URL/PATH helper.
  # The auto-generated path helper will be `contact_us_path` while after we added the `as:` option, it will just be `contact_path`
  get('/contact_us', {to:'contact#new', as:'contact'})
  # get '/contact_us' =>'contact#new', as: 'contact'
  post('/contact', {to:'contact#create', as:'contact_submit'})

  #this will make the home page of the application go to WelcomeController with index action
  root 'welcome#index'

  resources :questions do
    resources :answers, only: [:create, :destroy]

    #Nesting resources :answers, only[:create, :destroy] in resources :questions will create the following routes
    # question_answers POST   /questions/:question_id/answers(.:format)     answers#create
    # question_answer DELETE /questions/:question_id/answers/:id(.:format) answers#destroy
  end

  resources :sessions, only: [:new, :create] do
    # when you define a route with `on: :collection` option, it skips having an
    # `:id` or `:session_id` as part of the generated URL
    delete :destroy, on: :collection

  # # the order of the URL matters because Rails gives higher priority for routes
  # # that appear first
  #
  # # Note that we don't need to put `as:` option in here because we used the same
  # # url for the `create` action. Indeed Rails will throw an error if you try to
  # # reuse a predefined path helper. Remember that the `as:` option defines a
  # # path/url helper which only generates a URL and isn't concerned about the
  # # VERB
  # get('/questions', { to: 'questions#index' })

  # patch('/questions/:id', {to:'questions#update'})
